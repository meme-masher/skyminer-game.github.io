# Skyminer
_A simple game about mining up asteroids for valuable metals._


Hello and welcome to Skyminer! In this game, you must send missions to asteroids to mine up their resources. At the beginning, you have a 50/50 chance of having your mission succeed in not ending in a disproportionate ball of flames. If you make it, you gain XP. Gaining XP will reduce the chance of failure. And remember, no matter how 'jinxed' your game seems, it's all random. Good luck! :)

## Version log
**2017-02-04** Skyminer pre-alpha 0.01 is [live](https://skyminer-game.github.io)! It includes:
* **Experience system** - every mission has a 1 / (XP+2) chance of crashing, and every successful mission rewards you with +1XP.
* **Money system** - every mission costs $1,000,000, and if it succeeds, has a profit output of -$100,000 to $1,900,000. I'm planning to include a basic shop in pre-alpha 0.02.
* **Loading system** - you may save and load games using _localStorage()_.
